# Nachlang
A toy compiler for a small programming language.

> Note: This is a rewrite of https://gitlab.com/ignaciodelmont/nachlang_ . I'm taking a more functional approach in this newer version, and I plan to build a more complete set of language features.

<br/>

This project uses [rply](https://rply.readthedocs.io/) for the Lexer and the Parser.
Once the AST is generated by the parser, I use that structure to generate llvm code using [llvmlite](https://pypi.org/project/llvmlite/).

<br/>

Code is not beautiful, especially in the `codegen.py` file, I'm still figuring out the simplest way of reading the tree and generating code from it, and this changes each time I nadd new features.
As the project gets more mature I'll start refactoring.
